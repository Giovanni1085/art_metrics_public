Some of the shrines and temple walls have been disfigured by ignorant tyrants and bigots from years ago who thought they could kill ideas by beheading statues. The disfiguring goes on today, but by dull unimaginative vandals who write their equally unimaginative names on every stretch of wall they can find. On one particular wall, the collective super imposing of fools over the work of artists had given rise to an beautiful collage of graffiti. It was as if the temple wall was cracking a joke at the vandals, no matter how hard they tried it could never be made ugly. It's beauty like cosmic energy, could not be destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

Those active in the crypto space might even recognize a few crypto-art opinion leaders here. For this particular cartoon, I also decided to make rare digital art specifically about rare digital art as a fun (and slightly) educational piece. 

In the beginning there was just physical art. This, of course, is creative work that exists as a tangible unique object or experience in some form. Then with the dawn of computers and the Internet, came digital art. This led to droves of physical artwork--both old and new--becoming electronically scanned, digitized, and almost instantly available for viewing (and copying) around the globe. 

Those things alone are radical advances in arts development. Yet it does not stop there. With new innovations in blockchain technology came something called rare digital art. The art world will never be the same. 

What is rare digital art? It is non-physical creative work existing in electronic format that is made in a limited supply and running on top of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. At all hours of the day, a person anywhere in the world can buy rare digital art with cryptocurrency and have proof of ownership as well as proof of the art's digital scarcity. How the times have changed right underneath our artsy noses. One could almost smell it... almost. Woah!",https://ipfs.pixura.io/ipfs/QmVFSGh78f3AuSh6teuizU7weYcLi8DTsxYh5jUPnZZWfx

This piece took quite some time to create.

I started out with the EOS logo and a dozen Weavesilk backgrounds, and progressively worked through combinations till I found something I would be proud of displaying.

Then, I passed it through nearly a dozen different Deep Style guide images, and the final selected version got yet another pass through Deep Style itself.

It represents the new competitor on the turing-complete blockchain landscape... Let's see if it gives Ethereum a run for its money, or leaves it in the dust !",https://ipfs.pixura.io/ipfs/QmWHYjMUT3oDPkUBMsYNy2pWFx6EG5i9KTahCnRbjkVuRt

I was intending for a more ""traditional"" symmetric piece, but I'd choosen the LanaCoin logo in advance to integrate into an artwork, as I found it interesting (though I had no idea about it's story). Whe n I created a couple of more or less symmetric pieces, Deep Style had other ideas, and added the touch of red. I found it looked superb with that little touch in it, so here we are !

Apparently, LanaCoin is a copy-paste coin that was created by Lana's father as a gift for her 10th birthday... pretty strange gift, but apparently Lana likes math so I suppose she might have found it interesting to have a coin named after her, with her dad taking care of maintaining it's network.

In any case, I really like how this one turned out !

While the initial inspiration for this art is a bit ancient, the concepts communicated in the drawing are ones that Dürer probably never could have imagined. Due to advances in modern cryptographic technology, digital art can now be coded to be crytographically rare and purchasable in limited editions with cryptocurrency. As a physical world comparison, this development is akin to issuing a limited edition print whereby only a few people can own the artwork. 

Therefore, as alluded to in this crypto beetle-themed artwork, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Steem, Bitcrystals, Counterparty, and other altcoins have bluntly spread into the realm of art. The creative arena will never be the same. No exterminator can contain this infestation. Next stop, world domination.",https://ipfs.pixura.io/ipfs/QmVsc6fmC8APrNy3xfcuZScfQ5Wig4Yw3d8dayGpShq124

Yet because I have created so many cartoons throughout my career, I usually then ask myself the following question; ""How can I turn this drawing into a good comic?""

Such is the case with this crypto-art comic featuring a turtle and a woman enjoying some time upon their Southern California balcony. The drawing started out as a quick and simple drawing of my wife reclining in her chair. In the background can be seen the mountains that ever-define the Angeles National Forest, which we have hiked through on many occasions.

Since my family had recently visited a pack of turtles on our walk through the campus ponds at Caltech (which is near our condo), I logically decided to infuse a turtle into my balcony drawing. Then I wondered what a conversation between a turtle and my wife might sound like. This was actually not hard to imagine, since at our previous Pasadena apartment, we had tiny little turtles as pets--yet sadly they all died. Nevertheless, none of those imaginings led me to good material for a comic.

Therefore my drawing just floated in limbo for a few weeks until I decided that the turtle should say something absurd, yet also topical to cutting-edge current events. And not coincidentally, there have been some interesting developments unfolding in the cryptocurrency space regarding various government regulations. My wife and I learned about some of these rulings at a great Blockchain Bash event in Santa Monica recently. In light of such things, I decided that this turtle must become a crypto-lawyer. That's when the comic sort of wrote itself.

Naturally, such a comic strip must be put on the blockchain. And it must be issued as a crypto-collectible. That's why you can now bid on it and buy it using cryptocurrency!",https://ipfs.pixura.io/ipfs/QmeJ8tdX4MfkiHoRBiTvRuBMApAyeTKfJth6dk4np3RkhF

First I had the inspiration for the above image and a few others which I had to create. Then I gathered a team of 2 photographers (plus myself), and 6 beautiful models. All of them are good friends, and they all agreed to participate in the project at no cost. 

We all traveled from northern Mexico to one of the worlds most exquisite beaches, in Cancun. I chose the model for this particular project, and we scouted the location. On the next day, we woke up before the Sun came up so that we would be ready at the place (actually inside the sea) when dawn happened, to capture the model being illuminated with the first rays of light. We photographed her, gorgeously nude, and took back home some awesome images. 

From a selection of photos, I then created an oil painting, with emphasis to capture the delicacy of the young woman and the deep blue of the surroundings. 

I then professionally photographed the painting, and worked digitally on the image, with Photoshop. I ran it through several filters and effects, some automatic and some manual, to get the impressionistic look I wanted; giving it the last little touches so that the most essential features, such as her face and hand, would be more realistic, while some of the rest would be almost lost. The image is in high resolution. 

That’s it!

This is a unique, SuperRare work of art, a 1 of 1 piece which went through all the above process, with the hope that you could take home some of the warmth and beauty of the beautiful young woman, and some of the freshness and energy of the Caribbean Sea.

One day in 1966 in the underground bunker in North Bay Canada, the large projection screen, instead of displaying a map with dots for aircraft, progressively showed a series of images, icons and eventually letters. It was as if an alien intelligence was learning to communicate with humans by reading the knowledge in the computer.

It is rare digital art that takes a comical turn to poke fun at crypto-technology as well as human relationships. While the theme of this comic is satirical, I do believe that there will soon come a technology that people will flock to because it claims to enhance us. Yet that same technology will end up destroying many people. So be on your guard.  

On a stylistic level, this cinematic edition of Blockhead Gear harkens back to the early days of my comic-book roots, where scene-to-scene pacing and black and white ink art were my simple tools of the trade. This is a one-of-a-kind crypto-collectible, my longest crypto-art animation to date, and one of my personal favorites.",https://ipfs.pixura.io/ipfs/QmTk7taMwasfT3BJhL4EEvr3ctsHDQAnUhLAzQW9mnRb2r

In Germany everyone knows this famous cathedral, but especially when you live so close to Cologne, like I do, you just can't ignore it. Most remarkable, it took 632 years to be finished.
""It is Germany's most visited landmark, attracting an average of 20,000 people a day, and [...] the largest Gothic church in Northern Europe [...]. The towers for its two huge spires give the cathedral the largest façade of any church in the world.""

Democritus, who puts the world on chance,
  Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,
  Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;

Of qualities I saw the good collector,

Berners-Lee proposed the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to keep track of experimental data at CERN. On 4th March 1989, precisely 30 years ago, he submitted the HTML proposal to his boss, Mike Sendall. ‘Vague, but exciting’, were the words that Sendall wrote on the proposal.

Starting from an original image of Tim working on a computer displaying some prehistoric Web pages, including the CERN one, I replaced the image pixels by the text characters composing the following excerpt of the original far-sighted proposal. I then moved the strings using Perlin noise.

""We should work toward a universal linked information system, in which generality and portability are more important than fancy graphics techniques and complex extra facilities. The aim would be to allow a place to be found for any information or reference which one felt was important, and a way of finding it afterwards. The result should be sufficiently attractive to use that the information contained would grow past a critical threshold."" Tim Berners-Lee

They are named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, later known as Fibonacci. In his 1202 book Liber Abaci, Fibonacci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been described earlier in Indian mathematics. It appears to have first arisen as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala on enumerating possible patterns of poetry formed from syllables of two lengths. The title of this work of art dedicated to Fibonacci numbers is the name of Pingala's cryptic formula describing Fibonacci numbers, misrau cha, meaning ""the two are mixed"". The animated image is a loop of the first 47 Fibonacci numbers with increasing font size, deliberately breaking the canvas limits. The 47th Fibonacci number, or 1,836,311,903, is the largest number of the sequence representable in datatype for integers used to store Fibonacci numbers in the Processing sketch that generates the image.

1. Auroville belongs to nobody in particular. Auroville belongs to humanity as a whole. But, to live in Auroville, one must be a willing servitor of the divine consciousness.
2. Auroville will be the place of an unending education, of constant progress, and a youth that never ages.
3. Auroville wants to be the bridge between the past and the future. Taking advantage of all discoveries from without and from within, Auroville will boldly spring towards future realisations.
3. Auroville will be a site of material and spiritual researches for a living embodiment of an actual human unity.

In this case, the newness of cryptocurrency and rare digital art concepts may take a little time to be fully absorbed by the culture across all generations. In the meantime, we will still have to keep track of all our addresses--one way or another. To give some background about the creation process of this art, I drew this digital comic fairly quickly on a touch screen computer. Then I colored it, animated it, and left its GIF motion file running on the computer for my two youngest kids to see. They are both teens... and they both agree that this art is really cool.

1930,SupeRare,SUPR,https://ipfs.pixura.io/ipfs/QmQN2Jbgnwq8stusKeSoM4mB8pbFAbnUFEakaf6ciMoRkR,The Sweet Smell of Crypto,"Who can resist the invigorating aroma of cryptocurrency mined through the persistent pumping of nasal passages? Finally, having a runny nose can lead to great profits! Breathe deep the smell of crypto-abundance. Only 1 copy of this crypto-collectible exists on the Ethereum blockchain. That means only 1 person at a time can own the digital edition that I have issued. You can buy this rare digital art on the SuperRare marketplace--if you have the nose for it. I came up with the idea for this crypto-art comic while driving home from an inspiring meeting at Cal State LA. That meeting had nothing to do with art or crypto. In fact it was a faith-based meeting which left me feeling grateful and extra excited about life. It was in the aftermath of this gathering that a totally unrelated and comical thought just popped into my mind. I actually consider it a fun bonus-present from God: that I was allowed to have a humorous vision of a person whose schnoz was being used to generate cryptocurrency. Being so fond of the silliness of such a nasal crypto-miner that I had imagined, I immediately sketched a very rough draft of the concept while at a peaceful Southern California stoplight. My old smartphone with stylus came in quite handy for this quick sketching task. In fact, I used the original rough draft, drawn hastily on my phone (a Samsung Note 3), as the bottom layer of the same file on which I drew the final digital animation for this comic. The program I used to draw this on my phone is called Autodesk SketchBook for Galaxy. I have cranked out a ton of drawings and finished artwork on this program, which came free with my phone. So it is definitely one of the best art tools I have ever acquired and used frequently. ",https://ipfs.pixura.io/ipfs/QmS7ALQPJCEv6wNRmBY5PLd4Z2t99Wzwoz8gTCcwBHPoau

DOSAGE: 20 - 35 mg. DURATION: 8 - 12 h. QUALITATIVE COMMENTS: (with 24 mg) I first became aware of something in about 10 minutes, a pleasant increase in energy. By 20 minutes it was getting pronounced and was a nice, smooth development. During the next hour positive and negative feelings developed simultaneously. Following a suggestion, I ate a bit of food even though I had not been hungry, and to my surprise all the negative feelings dropped away. I felt free to join the others wherever they were at. I moved into the creative, free-flowing kind of repertoire which I dearly love, and found everything enormously funny. Much of the laughter was so deep that I felt it working through buried depressions inside me and freeing me. From this point on, the experience was most enjoyable. The experience was characterized by clear-headedness and an abundance of energy which kept on throughout the day and evening. At one point I went out back and strolled along to find a place to worship. I had a profound sense of the Presence and great love and gratitude for the place, the people, and the activities taking place. The come-down from the experience was very gradual and smooth. Food tasted wonderful. I went to bed late, and quite ready for bed, although the energy was still running. However, sleep was not long in coming. (with 24 mg) The onset was extremely gradual and graceful, with the first alert that one could really sense at about 50 minutes. This was succeeded by a slow gentle climb to the peak at one hour and fifteen minutes. The experience itself left all of the sensory modalities functional; speech was cogent and rather fluid. In fact, there was an unusual ease of free association. All throughout the session, the talk was high in spirits and somehow indicative of an inner excitement. Affect was entirely pleasant, but not exalting nor conducive to insight or to problem solving. There were no requirements for withdrawal into the self. The material seemed wholly social in nature. No visual, auditory or olfactory sharpening was in evidence. The plateau for this material seemed unusually long. I was unable to sleep for several hours, and took 25 mg Librium before sleep arrived. The next day was a lethargic and slow one, with the inner feeling that the effects had not worn off until the middle of the day following ingestion.

A set of such tiles is selected, and copies of the tiles are arranged side by side with matching colors, without rotating or reflecting them.

The basic question about a set of Wang tiles is whether it can tile the plane or not, i.e., whether an entire infinite plane can be filled this way. The algorithmic problem of determining whether a tile set can tile the plane became known as the domino (or tiling) problem.

In 1966, Wang's student Robert Berger proved the domino problem is undecidable (no algorithm for the problem can exist).

The negativity of indulging these compulsions and the isolating nature of removing yourself from the temptation.

The family--as a theme--has been a major recurring element in my professional art and comics career. It has been that way for almost as long as I can remember. Perhaps that comes as no surprise, considering that I have been putting out Silly Daddy Comics since 1992. That's the year after I first became a father. And that was a long time ago. Since the circle represents unity, and since unity is what all reasonable families genuinely desire, I set out to make some animated digital art that rotates in a circle, represents the family, and communicates a happy, fun unity. The heads of the family are positioned quite close together. This signifies the common desire of family members to bond in closeness and warmth toward each other. The abstract star-shape in the center shows that my wife and kids are a bright twinkle in my eye. Using various stages of my Silly Daddy Family logo, which I also refer to as the Silly Daddy Avatar, I combined the old and new versions of this family design to highlight the change as well as demonstrate growth and progress over time. Such things should be evident in an artist's work. Moreover, such things like growth and progress should be evident in a healthy family. A common manner in which families bond is through shared experiences, including movies and television. This is why it seemed fitting to infuse my artwork with a retro television style. Being experimental in my artwork has always been an important part of the creative process. So the unpredictable glitches that decorate this animation bring me great delight. In my mind, the glitches make it more real, because real life, and the pursuit of unity can be full of real glitches. Yet unity is still entirely worth pursuing. Videos and movies often have a big impact on families, mine included. I recall my Dad and Mom taking us kids to the movies to see Star Wars back in the 1970s. It created an epic memory--from that point forward I believed being a hero was entirely possible. And my parents helped nurture such a dream. Similarly, I also recall watching cartoons and kids' shows with my children when they were little: Barney the Dinosaur, Thomas the Tank Engine, Bob the Builder... the list goes on. My biggest memory of those peaceful times is one of safety. I was happy being with my children and knowing that they were safe. And I hope that they have safe memories of me and my wife as they grow older and come to appreciate the role of parenting more and more. Perhaps a picture of Barney the Dinosaur will remind them of that safe feeling. Or perhaps all they need to see is my smiling face. Here is to safety, to unity, to family, forever!

Now and then, with probability of 15%, some odd characters (with ASCII code in 123–255) are introduced in the text at random positions, and with 40% probability they are randomly colored. The space between normal characters and the size of them are also decided randomly. My first experiment with glitch poetry, coded in Processing language, is with a poem I love, L’infinito, written by Giacomo Leopardi in 1819. ---

in my physical brain.” (That which one believes to be true,
is true, or becomes true, at first within limits to be found
experimentally. These limits themselves, are beliefs to be
transcended.)
I am not limited by the known physical senses, known
physical signals sent/received by my brain. (Transcended,
these limits are left behind. I send/receive messages by
means unknown with unknown entities greater than me.)
Beyond transcendence is an infinite variety of unknowns.
(I move from my brain into other universes and
spaces, other slates of being. Once lived, these unknowns
are no longer unknown.)
In the other universes and spaces, the other states of
being, are teachers, guardians. (Beyond these unknowns,
now known, is full c omplete Truth.)
The guardians/teachers make me aware, help me be
aware, and help me to experience, when I’m ready, realities
beyond belief, beyond proof, beyond demonstration,
beyond theory, beyond imagination. (Beyond that Truth,
full and complete, are unknowns.)
The teachers' teachers take over my lessons. (New unknowns
become known. The cycle repeats. Mastered, these
unknowns are transcended.

DOSAGE: 5 - 10 mg. DURATION: 6 - 8 h. QUALITATIVE COMMENTS: (with 5 mg) The initial hints of action were physical--warming of first the legs, and then a comfortable warmth spread over the entire body. Intense intellectual stimulation, one that inspired the scribbling of some 14 pages of handwritten notes. Which is a pretty good record for an experience that is almost entirely non-verbal. The afterglow was benign and rich in empathy for everything. And by the sixth hour I was quite hungry. (with 10 mg) There was a rapid shift of frame of reference that made simple tasks such as reading and tuning the radio quite alien. I happened to catch the eyes of Pretty Baby, the cat, at the same moment she looked at me, and she turned and fled. I am able to interact with people on the telephone quite well but mechanical things, such as arranging flowers or alphabetizing names, are beyond me. Driving would be impossible.

Within the collection there exists numerous skulls of various shapes, sizes, colors and animations. Each piece is created using generative art techniques and is titled with the prefix “SF” and then numbered chronologically.

Why skulls? Because skulls are powerful. Skulls are symbolic. They are open for interpretation. And although they might have connotations of death, for many, death is just a turning point in the story of life. What do skulls mean to you?",https://ipfs.pixura.io/ipfs/QmW8pLRraYsChudo6zDEEL4aALR9wEr4c1PPkTxdbhTbQZ
